                Hello world! I am Stanley, the cat. Welcome to my website. I am an up and coming celebrity cat. My
                dream is to become as famous as my idol, Garfield, the cat. I want to become the greatest cat of all
                time! This is my venture into social media and the internet. I hope to posts lots of content in the
                future. My team and I are continuously planning and organizing events so that I can interact and
                meet with my fans. Please stay tuned for upcoming projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am from Toronto, Ontario, Canada and have lived here all my life. Currently the city is in a
                frenzy for the Toronto Raptors basketball team. We are in the NBA Finals for the first time! I am a
                big basketball fan and really excited that the Toronto Raptors are in the NBA Finals contending for
                the championship. I will be cheering them on and wish them the best luck in their pursuit.
